With the introduction of computers quickly arising, she taught herself and her staff FORTRAN. She later headed the programming section of the Analysis and Computation Division (ACD) at Langley",

This segregated group consisted of African-American women who made complex mathematical calculations by hand, using tools of the time. Seeing that machine computers were going to be the future, she taught the women programming languages and other concepts to prepare them for the transition. Vaughan continued after NASA, the successor agency, was established in 1958. When NACA became NASA, segregated facilities, including the West Computing office, were abolished.",
