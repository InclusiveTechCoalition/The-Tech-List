In April 2019, the telescope achieved the first direct observation of a black hole and the accretion disk surrounding it. The images of the black hole—in the M87 galaxy—made international news when they were released. The ability to closely observe the areas around black holes is expected to be vital in the study of the nature of space, gravity, and the refining our understanding of general relativity.",
