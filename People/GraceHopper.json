    "notes": "Grace Hopper was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. In recognition for her lifetime achievements, Grace Hopper received over 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world.",

Hopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973. She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization proram for the entire Navy. Hopper temporarily retired two times over the course of her career (in 1966 and 1971), but was recalled each time. In 1986, she permanently retired with the rank of rear admiral."

Her work eventually led to the development of COBOL, a human-readable programming language still in use today. In 1954, Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming."
